dirty-hacked plugin.video.netflixbmc
=======================
This is a fork of https://github.com/andrewleech/plugin.video.netflixbmc

It just fixed latest season-episode list on TV Shows and has genres working but only in Netflix Spain (we just got it, we just started hacking with it :) ) Instead of using api-global.netflix.com parses the html of the TV Show (ugly I know) and gets the episodes.

Beware! TV Shows genres are hardcoded in spanish.
